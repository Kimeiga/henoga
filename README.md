# henoga

Hosted on itch.io at https://kimeiga.itch.io/henoga. I was thinking of hosting it myself (on github pages or now.sh), but this is easier, and it has comments so I don't have to integrate them myself, and it has a game playing community already, so it's more likely to get exposure.

https://www.heno.ga redirects to the itch.io. This was set up with Freenom.

TODO:
1. Clean up files
2. Rename project to Henoga
3. Rename p2's animations to p2-*
4. Delete old assets and objects.
5. Polish level for widescreen in browser
6. **Add more guns**

Important to play this with other people to get a sense of what mechanics to change and stuff.
- Should bullets really pass through walls?
- Should random weapons spawn in random positions every 10 seconds like they do?
- Should the movement or shoot mechanics change?
- etc.
